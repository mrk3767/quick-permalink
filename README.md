# quick-permalink

A Google Mail addon which displays a permalink to the currently opened email. The permalink opens a to a window which
does not load the full GMail interface which is much faster.

# Installation

1. Install `clasp`
    - I do this using `brew i -g clasp`
2. Login with `clasp login`
3. `clasp create`
4. `clasp push`
5. `clasp open`
6. Run the `quick-permalink.gs` file once to accept permissions
7. Click the arrow next to `Deploy` in the upper-right
8. Click `Test deployments`
9. At the bottom, install to Gmail

# Usage

In Gmail, you should now have a black permalink icon on the right-hand app bar. If you open that up and select an email,
you should see the permalink
